          <p>Here it is! The most amazing collection of songs by the most amazing group of high school nerds making the most amazing punk rock you&rsquo;ve never heard. This collection spans the entire career of this seminal punk rock band from 1994 to 1997. They inspired a generation of nerdy kids to not only become vegan and straight edge, but to pick up instruments, make up dumb songs, and get up on a stage and play &lsquo;em for their friends. The members of this band went on to be in such other amazing bands as Birthright, Fallopian Vultures, Room 101, Wasteland DC, Bacchus D, XcarebearsX, Bling Theatre, Rise Over Run, Horizon, Spunkmeyer, Slow Motion Enslavement, You&rsquo;ve Got Male, Breaking Away, Upstate, Harpers Ferry Arsenal, Snake Attak!, and MANY others. Listen to this and you WILL feel like a complete person.</p>

            Jocks from hell will kick my ass,

            <br>I&rsquo;m a wuss, I have no pride,
            <br>To me wussiness is a way of life,
            <br>It bother me not, comma, stab me with a knife,
            <br>I don&rsquo;t have muscles, I&rsquo;m a weak pathetic fool,
            <br>Got beat up last year at the pool
            <br>I really suck and I ain&rsquo;t cool
