            This song describes us to a T. It was written by some dude in Nate's English class.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Jocks from hell will kick my ass,
            <br />I'm a wuss I don't smoke grass,
            <br />I don't drink beer, it's a goddamn shame,
            <br />I'm a wuss, and I'm to blame,
            <br />I don't get chicks I take it in stride,
            <br />I'm a wuss, I have no pride,
            <br />To me wussiness is a way of life,
            <br />It bother me not, comma, stab me with a knife,
            <br />I don't have muscles, I'm a weak pathetic fool,
            <br />Got beat up last year at the pool
            <br />I really suck and I ain't cool
            <br />I'm a fuck and I'm a tool

            While watching a kids' game show on Nickelodeon, we saw this amazing kid named Cameron. He was the punkest kid you've ever seen. They must have hopped him up on some serious sugar before shoving him in front of that camera. Wow.

            <br />Cooler than the cameron girl at my school
            <br />You're you idol, you are so cool
            <br />You're my idol, you are the best
            <br />You're my idol, you're goddamn hilarious
            <br />You're my idol
            <br />Tell your sister to get out of town
            <br />Cameron you are such a clown
            <br />And I thought it was really cool
            <br />When you put your hand over your sister's mouth (that shut her up)

            <br />Just sit around and wonder why
            <br />In this relationship I got screwed
            <br />Cause you hate me and I still love you
            <br />And it seems you don't care anymore
            <br />You just don't seem to care
            <br />And it seems you don't love me anymore
            <br />Why don't you care?
            <br />This was one great relationship
            <br />Now it feels like a pile of shit
            <br />I always thought we'd had a lot of fun
            <br />Now I wonder what have I done

            I like the bird, the bird is cool, I like the bird, the bird is cool
            <br />I hate the cat, the cat is fat, I hate the cat, the cat is fat
            <br />I like the dog, the dog is cool, I like the dog, the dog is cool
            <br />I like the squirrel, it's in the tree, and I fell and I skinned my knee
            <br />I like the bird, the bird is cool, I like the bird, the bird is cool
            <br />I hate the cat, the cat is fat, I hate the cat, the cat tried to eat the bird
            <br />I like the duck it's in the pond, and of the duck I am very fond
            <br />I like the bird, the bird is cool, I like the bird, the bird is cool

            You think being a Nazi is A-OK

            <br />???? out of whack
            <br />You're too ignorant to realize that

      <p>Here it is! The most amazing collection of songs by the most amazing group of high school nerds making the most amazing punk rock you've never heard. This collection spans the entire career of this seminal punk rock band from 1994 to 1997. They inspired a generation of nerdy kids to not only become vegan and straight edge, but to pick up instruments, make up dumb songs, and get up on a stage and play 'em for their friends. The members of this band went on to be in such other amazing bands as Birthright, Fallopian Vultures, Room 101, Wasteland DC, Bacchus D, XcarebearsX, Bling Theatre, Rise Over Run, Horizon, Spunkmeyer, Slow Motion Enslavement, You've Got Male, Breaking Away, Upstate, Harpers Ferry Arsenal, Snake Attak!, and MANY others. Listen to this and you WILL feel like a complete person.</p>
